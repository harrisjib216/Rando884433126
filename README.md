# Rando884433126
The goal of this program is to practice some programming principles/
constructs. Rando884433126, first detects if you submitted a file ending 
in ".rando884433126" or if you submitted a string. Depending on which
program you ran (translate or decipher), Rando884433126 will then
translate your text or decipher it.


But how does Rando884433126 decipher your code??


Well, Rando884433126, is actually a language!! A very difficult one
actually. For now, Rando884433126, takes the ascii value for each 
character in the respective word and sums itself. If that doesn't
make sense, then... idk, use a different program...


Just kidding!
Here's an example.

> ummm, cipher my text please: hello
> I mean... i guess i'll help you: *****


I haven't actually got to the deciphering yet because as I wrote this code,
I figured that's like trying to decrypt sha256, so for now, you can't decipher :(



# DECIDE IF IT'S A FILE OR A STRING
    ./translate.py hello
    ./decipher.py 110044                        -- in the works...

or

    ./translate.py fileName.rando884433126
    ./decipher.py fileName.rando884433126        -- in the works again....



# TRANSLATING
See "translate.py"


# SAVING
Lastly, you can also tell Rando884433126 to append your translation
to your old file.
    
    ./translate.py appendPls.rando884433126 +@ap_pe#nd
    ./decipher.py appendPls.rando884433126 +@ap_pe#nd                   -- in the works... still..
